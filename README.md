# ESP32-MFRC522-RFID-reader-writer

## Purpose
The **ESP32-MFRC522-RFID-reader-writer** is a module designed to interface the **ESP32-C3-mini-1** with the **MFRC522 RFID** reader/writer. It enables the detection, reading, and writing of RFID tags. This module is ideal for applications that require NFC or RFID capabilities such as access control, asset management, inventory systems, and more.

## Features
- **Detection**: The module can detect RFID tags within range and retrieve information like UID (Unique Identifier).
- **Reading**: The ability to read data from RFID tags, displaying the tag's contents.
- **Writing**: It can write data to compatible RFID tags, such as MIFARE Classic cards.

## Applications
This module can be used in various applications, including but not limited to:
- **Access Control Systems**: Grant or deny access based on RFID tag data.
- **Asset Management**: Keep track of items using RFID tags.
- **Inventory Management**: Use RFID tags to automate the process of tracking stock and inventory.
- **Payment Systems**: Integrate with payment systems that use RFID tags or cards.

## Requirements
To use the **ESP32-MFRC522-RFID-reader-writer**, you will need the following:
- **Hardware**:
  - **ESP32-C3-mini-1** microcontroller board
  - **MFRC522 RFID Reader/Writer module**
  - **RFID tags/cards** (e.g., MIFARE Classic)
  - Jumper wires and a breadboard for connections

- **Software**:
  - Arduino IDE with ESP32 support
  - MFRC522 library for Arduino (available from the library manager)

## Installation
1. Install the **ESP32 board** in the Arduino IDE.
2. Install the **MFRC522 library** via the Arduino Library Manager.
3. Connect the **ESP32-C3-mini-1** to the **MFRC522 module** following the pinout.
4. Upload the provided code to the ESP32.

## Usage
1. Power on the system with the **ESP32** and **MFRC522 module** connected.
2. Open the **Serial Monitor** in Arduino IDE.
3. You can choose different modes (e.g., detect, read, write) from the interactive menu in the Serial Monitor.

## Warnings and Safety Precautions
- **Avoid Short Circuits**: Ensure all connections are correctly made to avoid damaging the components.
- **Use Proper Voltage**: The ESP32 and MFRC522 module typically operate at 3.3V. Do not apply higher voltages to avoid damage.
- **RFID Tag Compatibility**: The system is designed for MIFARE Classic tags. Other RFID tags may not be supported.
- **Avoid Physical Damage**: Handle the ESP32 and MFRC522 module with care, especially the RFID moduleâ€™s antenna.
